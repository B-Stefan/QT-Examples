You find the results in the ./../results folder as screenshots.
For further information read the ./../Readme.md.


## Task 1 - RegEx 
Handle strings with RegEx.

For me personally RegEx are always hard to read after a few week so from the maintenance point not to recommend. 
But for some tasks they are necessary and very fast. 


##Task 2 - Sorting
 Sort Vector and QVector via sort functions

 Handle classes in a Map structure

After this task I was a little bit confused because QT did not delte the books before the program destroyed. 
So I decide to do this manual, in the [Task 4](#Task 4 - Classes)
