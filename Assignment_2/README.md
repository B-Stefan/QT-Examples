## Task 1 - Text Editor – version 1 & 2

To run the program in the main folder (../)
```
    cmake --target QT-Assignments-Assignment-2-TextEditor
```
 
The fist version of the Text Editor includes the basic load and save functions 
For example the following functions 

* Open new file (new window) 
* Save file 
* Open existing file from hard drive 

I have noticed that the quit button and about button on my operating system (MacOSX) appear directly in the specific menu bar. 
Instead of the defined position under "File"
